     <p>Stepping into B.Tech feels like unlocking a new level in life.<br> </p> <p> The world of circuits, code, and endless possibilities.
There's a spark in my fingers a</p> <p> rush in my mind — I can't wait to write that first line of code.
The future is a blank</p> <p> screen, and I'm ready to type my story into it, one algorithm at a time.
Every “Hello,</p> <p> World!” will echo with ambition, and every bug I squash will be a badge of honor.</p> <p>
This is more than a course — it’s the beginning of my journey into the language of </p> <p>the future.</p>
